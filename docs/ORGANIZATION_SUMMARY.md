### 2. Enhanced Development Workflow
- ✅ **Enhanced Scripts**: typecheck, format, test, clean
- ✅ **Environment Validation**: Type-safe env variables
- ✅ **Testing Setup**: Jest configuration with mocking
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Prettier, ESLint configuration
- ✅ **Error Boundaries**: React error boundary component

### 3. Business Logic Implementation
- ✅ **Lead Workflows**: State transition validation
- ✅ **Approval Rules**: Estimate approval with role-based access
- ✅ **Business Constants**: Pricing, commission rates, service areas
- ✅ **Validation Schemas**: Comprehensive Zod validation

### 4. Service Layer Improvements
- ✅ **Analytics Service**: Consolidated dashboard stats, metrics
- ✅ **Business Services**: Enhanced leads service with workflow logic
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage

### 5. Utility Functions
- ✅ **Calculations**: Insulation R-value, pricing calculations
- ✅ **Formatting**: Currency, dates with internationalization
- ✅ **Validation**: Input validation with helpful error messages

## 🚀 Application Status

### ✅ Successfully Running
- **Development Server**: ✅ Runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Environment**: ✅ Configured with Supabase credentials  
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Installed successfully
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ Working without runtime errors

### ⚠️ Known Issues (Pre-existing)
- **TypeScript Errors**: ~142 errors (mostly existing codebase issues)
- **ESLint Warnings**: ~175 warnings (code quality improvements needed)
- **Twilio Integration**: Requires proper credentials for SMS/voice features

## 📋 Next Steps for Production

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   ```bash
   npm run lint -- --fix  # Fix auto-fixable issues
   npm run typecheck      # Address TypeScript errors
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Add proper Twilio credentials if SMS/voice needed
   - Configure Resend for email notifications
   - Set up production environment variables

3. **Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run test          # Run test suite
   npm run test:coverage # Check test coverage
   ```

4. **Performance Optimization**
   ```bash
   npm run analyze       # Analyze bundle size
   ```
